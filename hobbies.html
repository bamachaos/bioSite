				<h2>A Heart for Service</h2>
				<p>Tammy is a perfect example of someone who always wants to help.  This is exemplified in everything she 
				does.  She will go out of her way to help our kids, grandkids, or the members of our church.  She is the same
				way at work with her patients and coworkers.</p>

			<p>"Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."  Matthew 20:28</p>
			<p>As you can see Tammy is very passionate about her Faith, her Church, and Serving others she invites you to learn more about these things by reading God's Word.
			The following link takes you to <a href="https://www.bible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bible.com</a> where you can start a Bible plan or just read.  My hope is that you will find Jesus and 
			your inspiration to serve others.</p>
